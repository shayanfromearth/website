## Introduction

Growing up music had a major impact on my life. I've seen the songs I listen to influence my mood and decisions for good or bad. My relationship with music bloomed as I entered my teen years and began to find my own musical identity, diverging from the songs my mom raised me on. But they say the apple does not fall far from the tree! For this text analysis, I will pull lyrics from the album I listened to most as a young teen and the album my mom listened to most at the same age, Lungs by Florence and the Machine and War by U2. The two albums could not be any more different on the surface, but the artists come from similar cultures and in their own ways redefined music for our generations. I would like to see whether there is similarities in sentiments between the music or distinctions that make them stand out as such great albums.

### Data Scraping and Wrangling

```{r songs}
load(here("_posts", "2022-03-10-text-analysis", "data", "florence_u2.RData"))
```


```{r}
#Make a function for purr

get_lyrics<-function(song,artist,album,year){
    
 #Create url base
  base1<-c("https://songlyrics.com/")

  base2<-c("-lyrics")

#Clean the artist name and song name to match the url
  artist_url <- str_replace_all(artist, pattern = "(?!\\!)[[:punct:]]", replacement = " ") %>% 
    str_replace_all(pattern = " ", replacement = "-") %>%
    str_to_lower() %>% 
    str_squish()

  song_url <- str_remove_all(song,pattern = "(?![&'])[[:punct:]]") %>%   #The (?!\\[!']) tells R to ignore all punct except & and '
    str_replace_all(pattern="'",replacement = "-") %>%   #This is a little thing I noticed specific to the website in how they handle apostrophes
    str_replace_all(pattern = "&", replacement = "-") %>% 
    str_replace_all(pattern = " ",replacement = "-") %>%
    str_to_lower() %>% 
    str_squish() 
  
  url <- paste(base1,artist_url,"/",song_url,base2,sep = "")
  
  #Test to see if the website actually has the song data. Try catch lets me define errors that purr will put out
  out<-tryCatch({
    read_html(url)
  },
  
  error=function(cond){

    return(NA)
  }
  
  )
 
  if(is.na(out)){
    
  stop(paste("Songlyrics.com doesn't have data on",artist,song,sep=" "))}  

  
  #Get the data from the website and clean it up

  extract<-read_html(url) %>%

    str_remove_all(pattern = "[[:punct:]]") %>% 
    str_to_lower() %>% 
    str_split(" ") %>% 
    as.data.frame() %>% 
    mutate(song = song, artist = artist, album = album, year = year) #Add other names
  colnames(extract)[1] <- "word"  #Use word here so it matches with stop_words

  unnest()
  
  ## From here we could row bind this to a "master" lyrics dataframe
```

## Lyrics Analysis

```{r}

## Sentiment Analysis {.tabset}

```{r}

             by = 'word')

u2_afinn_means <- u2_afinn %>% 
  group_by(song) %>% 
  summarize(mean_affin = mean(value))

# for nrc sentiment analysis, I only want to compare 4 best songs from each album

### Tracklist NRC Sentiment Analysis


```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 9}

ggplot(data = florence_nrc_counts,
       aes(x = sentiment, 
           y = n)) +

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 9}
ggplot(data = u2_nrc_counts,
       aes(x = sentiment, 
           y = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = 'indianred') +
  facet_wrap( ~song, scales = "fixed") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(y = "Amount of NRC Words",
       x = "NRC Sentiment",

## Conclusion

Released 26 years apart from one another, Lungs and War share one central theme: love. Both albums are ripe with emotion, written with motifs of mortality and the heaviness of life. The Afinn analysis shows both albums span a spectrum of emotion, represented by songs assumed to be very positive and very negative. The NRC analysis further shows that both artists are unafraid to write about the full spectrum of emotion. 

This analysis cannot truly compare two albums of so much significance, but it shows two albums full of emotional lyrics that speak to teenage angst in unique and creative ways.
