## About 

I am a multimedia storyteller and environmental scientist working to bring attention to environmental and social conflicts. Currently, I am a master's student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara, studying  economics and politics of the environment with a focus in strategic communications. 
I aspire to support social justice movements through community-based research and policy advocacy.
